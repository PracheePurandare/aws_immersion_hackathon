Security scans in Q Developer identify security vulnerabilities and suggest how to improve your code. In some cases, Q Developer provides code you can use to address those vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In this workshop we will show you actual samples of insecure code and how Amazon Q Developers detects them along with providing examples for remediation.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>An AWS account is not required for this workshop as we are using the Free Tier version of Amazon Q Developer.
